# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the Rasberry Pi as well as making sure the computer vision worked. However, my endevours were fraught with technical errors, displaying open cv error messages. After some time debugging, I intsalled the correct version of open cv, as well as enabling the camera to turn on, on the Rasberry Pi.
