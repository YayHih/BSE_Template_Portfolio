# Final Milestone
In my final milestone, I implemented a UI so my device can be used remotely.

# Second Milestone
In my second milestone, I moved over from a TensorFlow model to a Nanonetsmodel. Because of this switch, there is no longer a 2 second lag behind the live feed, and there is a greater level of accuracy with the Nanonets model as it goes to a server for all of its processes. In this milestone I have also trained my own dataset of birds, so my model can correctly identify each type.

# First Milestone 
My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi as well as making sure the computer vision worked. However, my endeavors were fraught with technical errors, displaying Open CV error messages. After some time debugging, I installed the correct version of Open CV. I also enabled the camera on the Raspberry Pi.
